1. 1/4 tsp heaping salt (RealSalt brand)
2. 3/4 cup macaroni noodles (Barilla elbow noodles)
3. ~1 oz medium cheddar cheese
4. 1 tbsp butter
5. Water to cover noodles

Simmer noodles for 7 minutes. strain water add salt, stir and dissolve salt in cooked noodles.
Cut cheese into 1/4" slices and mix with hot noodles for a minute so it will melt, then stir in.
Add 1 tbsp butter after cheese is mixed to melt and serve.

###### Tips
* Many noodle recipes call for lots of water, just use enough to cook the noodles and no more
* The starch on the cooked noodles helps the cheese stick as it melts, if the cheese does not stick to the noodles well add a bit of starch or flour
