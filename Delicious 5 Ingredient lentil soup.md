* 1/4 cup lentils
* 1 sliced medium potato
* frozen spinach to taste
* 2 cups water
* 1 tsp salt

Combine all except salt, simmer mixture uncovered on low for 45 minutes, add salt, serve.

##### Tips
* Tricky to get right, simmering low uncovered preserves the tenderness of the lentils
* Ideally you want to simmer on a setting to where no bubbles are agitating the lentils
* Add curry powder, turmeric and cumin to taste for extra zazz
