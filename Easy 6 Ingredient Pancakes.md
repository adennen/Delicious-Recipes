1. 1/2 - 1 Tsp salt (RealSalt brand)
2. 2 Tsp Baking Soda (Rumford aluminum-free)
3. 1 oz cooking oil (Safflower oil)
4. 1 Cup Flour (King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour)
5. 1 Egg
6. 1 Cup Liquid (Water, Milk, or Kool-Aidâ„¢)

Combine oil and dry ingredients and mix, add in Egg and Liquid and mix. Oil a pan and heat between medium and medium-high. Add batter to pan in desired sizes, cook about 2:30 per side. Oil pan as necessary

##### Tips
* Use lots of butter
* Add pads of butter to the pancakes when they come off the pan so the butter melts faster
* To cut down on cooking time I usually make 3 large pancakes
